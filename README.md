# linkedin-list-contributions
I invite those who wish to collaborate to add their name, GitHub link,
and LinkedIn above the list. The aim here is to practice collaborative
work and increase visibility on networks by simply participating in an
open-source project. I thank all those who will participate and look
forward to receiving your pull requests.
